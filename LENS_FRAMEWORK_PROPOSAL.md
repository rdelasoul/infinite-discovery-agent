# Lens Framework Proposal

## The Problem

**Current State**: We have experiment types that are either:
- **Rich with content** (ui-components: 35+ iterations, multi-card-banking: 15+ iterations)
- **Empty templates** (ui-innovations, interactions, functional-ux-patterns: minimal/no iterations)

**The Dilemma**: 
- The empty ones have great analytical frameworks but clutter the main experiments directory
- I want to apply analytical thinking from empty experiments to existing rich content
- Example: "Take my proven banking interface and apply interaction design thinking to it"

## The Proposed Solution: Lens Framework

### Core Concept
**Separate analytical approaches from domain content**

- **Domains**: Banking, UI components, websites (your actual work)
- **Lenses**: Innovation thinking, interaction design, functional patterns (analytical approaches)
- **References**: Point to existing work to build upon

### Simple Structure
```
experiments/
├── _lenses/              # Analytical approaches (moved from main)
│   ├── ui-innovations/
│   ├── interactions/
│   └── functional-patterns/
├── ui-components/        # Keep as-is (rich content)
├── multi-card-banking/   # Keep as-is (rich content)
├── bank-relationship-intelligence/  # Keep as-is
└── website-homepages/    # Keep as-is
```

### Ultra-Simple Usage

**Everything you do today stays exactly the same:**
```bash
/infinite ui-components 5                    # Unchanged
/infinite multi-card-banking 3              # Unchanged
/infinite website-homepages/project-name 5  # Unchanged
```

**New capability - apply lens to existing work:**
```bash
/infinite interactions 3    # No command-line flags needed!
```

That's it. Configuration-based approach via `spec-config.yml`

## How It Works

### Behind the Scenes
1. The `spec-config.yml` includes your existing work as references
2. The lens (e.g., `interactions`) provides the analytical framework
3. Agents get: "Take this proven banking interface and apply interaction design thinking"

### What Agents Receive
```
TASK: Apply interaction design thinking to existing banking interface

REFERENCE WORK: [Contents of ux_pattern_14.html]
ANALYTICAL LENS: [Interaction design principles from _lenses/interactions/]
OUTPUT: Enhanced version with interaction design improvements
```

## Simplified Implementation (Recommended)

### Configuration-Based Approach
**No command-line flags needed!** Everything configured in `spec-config.yml`:

```yaml
# experiments/interactions/spec-config.yml
dependencies:
  references:
    - multi-card-banking/current/ux_pattern_14.html
  format: astro-component  # For Astro compatibility
  design-systems:
    - geist-core
  spec-modules:
    - accessibility-standards
    - performance-requirements
  moodboards:
    - modern-minimalist
  data:
    - banking-data
```

### Simple Format Evolution
```yaml
# Start with current HTML
format: single-file

# Move to component structure
format: component-split  # HTML + CSS + JS files

# Deploy-ready Astro
format: astro-component  # .astro files with TypeScript
```

### What We're NOT Adding
- **No command-line flags** (keeps syntax clean)
- **No deployment pipeline** (focus on format only)
- **No multi-reference complexity** (single reference per experiment)
- **No framework options beyond format** (just 3 formats)

## Concrete Examples

### Example 1: Enhance Your Banking Success
**Scenario**: You have a great banking interface, want to make it more delightful

```bash
# Your current banking interface (proven)
# → experiments/multi-card-banking/current/ux_pattern_14.html

# Configure: experiments/interactions/spec-config.yml
# references:
#   - multi-card-banking/current/ux_pattern_14.html

# Apply interaction design thinking
/infinite interactions 3

# Result: Same banking interface + interaction design improvements
```

### Example 2: Innovation on UI Components
**Scenario**: You have a brilliant UI component, want to push it further

```bash
# Your proven component (works great)
# → experiments/ui-components/current/ui_hybrid_23.html

# Configure: experiments/_lenses/ui-innovations/spec-config.yml
# references:
#   - ui-components/current/ui_hybrid_23.html

# Apply innovation thinking
/infinite ui-innovations 5

# Result: Revolutionary versions of your proven component
```

### Example 3: Cross-Domain Application
**Scenario**: Apply UI innovation to banking domain

```bash
# Configure: experiments/_lenses/ui-innovations/spec-config.yml
# references:
#   - multi-card-banking/current/ux_pattern_14.html

# Take UI innovation and apply to banking
/infinite ui-innovations 3

# Result: Banking interface with UI innovation principles
```

## Advanced Scenarios (The Scary Stuff)

> ⚠️ **Warning**: These scenarios show where this approach could lead WITHOUT proper boundaries. Our simplified implementation prevents most of this complexity.

### How Our Simplified Approach Prevents Complexity:
- **Configuration-based**: No command-line flag proliferation
- **Format-only**: No deployment pipeline complexity
- **Single references**: No multi-reference dependency webs
- **Bounded scope**: Clear limits on what we won't add

### What Could Happen (If We Don't Maintain Boundaries):

### Complex Evolution Chains

**The Progression That Could Happen:**
```bash
# Month 1: Create great banking UX
/infinite multi-card-banking 5
# Output: experiments/multi-card-banking/runs/2025-01-16/iterations/ux_pattern_14.html

# Month 2: Apply interaction lens to banking success
/infinite interactions 3  # Reference configured in spec-config.yml
# Output: experiments/_lenses/interactions/runs/2025-02-15/iterations/interaction_3.html

# Month 3: Apply innovation lens to the interaction-enhanced banking
/infinite ui-innovations 2  # Reference configured in spec-config.yml
# Output: experiments/_lenses/ui-innovations/runs/2025-03-10/iterations/innovation_2.html

# Month 4: Apply functional patterns to the innovative banking
/infinite functional-patterns 5  # Reference configured in spec-config.yml
# Output: experiments/_lenses/functional-patterns/runs/2025-04-05/iterations/pattern_5.html
```

**The Result**: A complex chain of experiment types, each building on the previous, creating a web of dependencies.

### Multi-Reference Complexity

**Advanced Reference Scenarios (We're NOT implementing these):**
```bash
# Compare how different lenses apply to same base work
/infinite interactions 3      # Reference in spec-config.yml
/infinite ui-innovations 3    # Reference in spec-config.yml
/infinite functional-patterns 3  # Reference in spec-config.yml

# Multiple references (NOT IMPLEMENTING - too complex)
# /infinite hybrid-banking 5 with multiple references

# Reference entire runs (NOT IMPLEMENTING - too complex)
# /infinite meta-banking 3 with run references
```

### Format Evolution (Simplified)

**Three Formats Only:**
```bash
# Phase 1: HTML mockups (current)
/infinite banking-cards 5
# Output: Single HTML files (format: single-file)

# Phase 2: Component-split format
# Configure: format: component-split in spec-config.yml
/infinite interactions 3
# Output: HTML + CSS + JS files

# Phase 3: Astro-ready components
# Configure: format: astro-component in spec-config.yml
/infinite interactions 3
# Output: .astro files with TypeScript

# Phase 4: Auto-deployment (NOT IMPLEMENTING)
# We stop at Astro-ready components
```

### Spec Configuration (Simplified)

**What config files will look like:**
```yaml
# experiments/_lenses/interactions/spec-config.yml
dependencies:
  references:
    - multi-card-banking/current/ux_pattern_14.html  # Single reference only
  
  format: astro-component  # Three formats: single-file, component-split, astro-component
  
  design-systems:
    - geist-core
  
  spec-modules:
    - accessibility-standards
    - performance-requirements
  
  moodboards:
    - modern-minimalist
  
  data:
    - banking-data
```

**Key Simplifications:**
- Single reference per experiment
- No deployment configuration
- No framework options beyond format
- No analytical_lens field (implied by directory)

### Directory Structure (Controlled)

**What the experiments directory will become:**
```
experiments/
├── _lenses/              # Analytical approaches only
│   ├── ui-innovations/
│   ├── interactions/
│   └── functional-patterns/
├── ui-components/        # Rich content (unchanged)
├── multi-card-banking/   # Rich content (unchanged)
├── bank-relationship-intelligence/  # Rich content (unchanged)
└── website-homepages/    # Rich content (unchanged)
```

**What we're NOT adding:**
- No `_output-formats/` directory
- No `_deployment/` directory
- No explosion of new experiment types
- No complex cross-dependencies

### Command Complexity (Prevented)

**What commands will look like:**
```bash
# The simple case (stays simple)
/infinite ui-components 5

# The lens case (also simple)
/infinite interactions 3

# No complex commands because everything is in spec-config.yml
```

**Complex commands we're NOT implementing:**
```bash
# This complexity is prevented by our approach
# /infinite client-demo 3 --reference ... --lens ... --format ...
```

### Maintenance Burden

**What you might need to track:**
- 20+ experiment types (some created, some lens-based)
- Complex reference chains across experiment types
- Multiple output formats and deployment targets
- Lens combinations and their interactions
- Format migration paths for existing work
- Deployment pipeline configurations
- Framework-specific adaptations

### The Slippery Slope (Prevented)

**How it might evolve (if we don't maintain boundaries):**
1. **Start**: Simple references in spec-config.yml
2. **Month 2**: Add format support (✅ we're doing this)
3. **Month 3**: Add deployment pipeline (❌ we're NOT doing this)
4. **Month 4**: Add framework options (❌ we're NOT doing this)
5. **Month 6**: Add multi-references (❌ we're NOT doing this)
6. **Month 8**: Add command-line flags (❌ we're NOT doing this)
7. **Month 10**: Add lens chains (❌ we're NOT doing this)
8. **Month 12**: Complex system (❌ we're preventing this)

**Our boundaries prevent this evolution.**

## Benefits

### ✅ **Addresses Current Problem**
- Removes clutter (empty experiments move to `_lenses/`)
- Keeps rich content in main experiments
- Enables applying analytical thinking to existing work

### ✅ **Minimal Learning Curve**
- Everything you do today stays the same
- References configured in familiar `spec-config.yml`
- Optional enhancement, not required

### ✅ **Powerful Combinations**

## Migration Path

### Step 1: Move Empty Experiments
```bash
mkdir experiments/_lenses
mv experiments/ui-innovations experiments/_lenses/
mv experiments/interactions experiments/_lenses/
mv experiments/functional-ux-patterns experiments/_lenses/
```

### Step 2: Update Commands
- Add `references` and `format` support to `/infinite` command
- Read from `spec-config.yml` (no command-line flags)
- Keep all existing functionality unchanged

### Step 3: Test
```bash
# Configure: experiments/_lenses/interactions/spec-config.yml
# references:
#   - ui-components/current/ui_hybrid_12.html

# Test the new capability
/infinite interactions 3
```

**That's it.** Everything else works exactly as before.

## Future Possibilities (Optional)

### Output Formats (Simple)
```yaml
# Configure format in spec-config.yml
format: component-split  # or astro-component
```

```bash
# When you're ready for Astro
/infinite interactions 3  # Uses format from config
```

### Advanced References (NOT implementing)
```bash
# We're NOT adding multiple references
# We're NOT adding run references
# We're NOT adding deployment pipeline
```

**Key Point**: All future features are optional. Core functionality is simple.

## Comparison with Alternatives

### Alternative 1: Delete Empty Experiments
❌ **Lose valuable analytical frameworks**
❌ **Can't apply systematic thinking to existing work**
✅ **Clean repository**

### Alternative 2: Keep Everything As-Is
❌ **Cluttered repository**
❌ **Can't easily apply analytical thinking to existing work**
✅ **No change required**

### Alternative 3: Lens Framework (This Proposal)
✅ **Clean repository structure**
✅ **Apply analytical thinking to existing work**
✅ **Minimal learning curve**

✅ **Optional enhancements**

## Decision Framework

### Choose Lens Framework If:
- You want to apply analytical thinking to existing work
- You like clean, organized repositories
- You want future flexibility
- You're comfortable with one new concept (`--reference`)

### Choose Alternative If:
- You never want to build on existing work
- You prefer absolute simplicity over capabilities
- You don't mind cluttered directories

## The Bottom Line

**Core Value**: Apply proven analytical frameworks to your existing successful work.

**Complexity**: References in `spec-config.yml` + moving empty experiments to `_lenses/`

**Future**: Optional enhancements for deployment pipeline when you're ready.

**Risk**: Minimal - everything you do today continues to work exactly the same.
