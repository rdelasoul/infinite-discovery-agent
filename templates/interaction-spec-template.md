## Interaction Dimensions

### **[Primary Interaction Concept]**
[Explain the main interaction pattern and its purpose]

#### **[Interaction Triggers]**
- **[Trigger 1]**: [User action and expected response]
- **[Trigger 2]**: [Alternative trigger and behavior]
- **[Trigger 3]**: [Context-sensitive trigger]

#### **[Feedback Mechanisms]**
- **Visual Feedback**: [How the interface responds visually]
- **Motion Feedback**: [Animation and transition approach]
- **Audio Feedback**: [Sound design considerations, if applicable]

### **[Interaction States]**
[Different states the interaction can have]

#### **[State 1]**
- **Appearance**: [Visual characteristics]
- **Behavior**: [Interactive capabilities]
- **Transitions**: [How it changes to other states]

#### **[State 2]**
- **Appearance**: [Visual characteristics]  
- **Behavior**: [Interactive capabilities]
- **Transitions**: [State change animations]

## Enhancement Principles

### **Performance Excellence**
- **60fps Animations**: [Technical requirements for smooth performance]
- **Hardware Acceleration**: [CSS properties that trigger GPU acceleration]
- **Efficient Event Handling**: [Debouncing, throttling, and optimization strategies]

### **Accessibility Standards**
- **Reduced Motion**: [Respect for prefers-reduced-motion user preference]
- **Keyboard Navigation**: [Full keyboard accessibility]
- **Screen Reader Support**: [ARIA labels and semantic markup]

### **User Experience**
- **Intuitive Feedback**: [Clear cause-and-effect relationships]
- **Appropriate Timing**: [Animation duration and easing curves]
- **Contextual Relevance**: [When and where the interaction should appear]

## Technical Requirements

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Animation Properties**: Use transform and opacity for best performance
- **Frame Rate**: Maintain 60fps across all supported devices
- **Memory Management**: Clean up event listeners and animation frames

### **Browser Compatibility**
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript
- **Fallback Behaviors**: Graceful degradation for older browsers
- **Touch Support**: Optimized for both mouse and touch interactions

### **Accessibility Compliance**
- **WCAG 2.1 AA**: Full compliance with accessibility guidelines
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order
- **Motion Sensitivity**: Respect user motion preferences

## Iteration Evolution Strategy

### **[Evolution Dimension 1]**
[How iterations should explore different aspects of the interaction]

### **[Evolution Dimension 2]**
[Alternative approaches and design variations]

### **Complexity Progression**
- **Simple (1-3)**: Basic interaction with single trigger/response
- **Enhanced (4-6)**: Multiple states and transition effects
- **Advanced (7+)**: Complex state machines and adaptive behaviors

## Quality Standards

### **Interaction Excellence**
- **Immediate Response**: [Response time requirements]
- **Clear Feedback**: [User understanding and confirmation]
- **Consistent Behavior**: [Predictable interaction patterns]

### **Technical Performance**
- **Loading Speed**: [Initial load performance]
- **Runtime Performance**: [Animation and interaction smoothness]
- **Resource Efficiency**: [Memory and CPU usage]

## Ultra-Thinking Directive

Before creating each [interaction type], deeply consider:

**User Psychology:**
- How does this interaction feel to use?
- What emotions does it evoke?
- Does it reduce or increase cognitive load?

**Technical Excellence:**
- How can we achieve maximum performance?
- What are the accessibility implications?
- How does this work across different devices?

**Design Integration:**
- How does this interaction fit into larger interface patterns?
- What visual language does it establish?
- How can it be adapted for different contexts?

**Innovation Balance:**
- Does this improve user experience or just add novelty?
- How does it compare to established interaction patterns?
- What makes this approach genuinely valuable?

**Generate interactions that are:**
- **Purposefully Delightful**: [Enhancing user experience meaningfully]
- **Technically Excellent**: [Smooth, performant, and accessible]
- **Contextually Appropriate**: [Fitting naturally into user workflows]
- **Innovatively Practical**: [Novel but genuinely useful]
