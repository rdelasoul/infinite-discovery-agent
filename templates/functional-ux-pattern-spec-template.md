# [User Goal/Workflow] UX Pattern Specification

## Core Challenge
[Describe the specific user workflow challenge this experiment addresses and the functional pattern innovation approach]

## Design System Input

**Design System**: 
- `design-systems/[system-name]-core.md` (Essential foundations: colors, typography, spacing, grid)
- `design-systems/[system-name]-components.md` (Component overview and usage guidance)

**Additional References** (load as needed):
- `design-systems/[system-name]-forms.md` - Form component details
- `design-systems/[system-name]-layout.md` - Layout component details  
- `design-systems/[system-name]-feedback.md` - Feedback component details
- `design-systems/[system-name]-status.md` - Status component details
- `design-systems/[system-name]-data.md` - Data display component details
- `design-systems/[system-name]-information.md` - Information component details

**Visual Constraints**:
- Use predefined color tokens and theme variables
- Follow typography scale and font families  
- Implement spacing system and grid layout
- Utilize component structure and interaction patterns
- Maintain accessibility standards and ARIA attributes

**Innovation Focus**:
- Information architecture optimization within design system components
- Workflow pattern exploration using consistent visual framework
- Task completion efficiency improvements without visual variation
- Cognitive load reduction through pattern innovation, not theme development

## Ultra-Thinking Directive

Before creating each [pattern type], deeply consider:

**User Goal Understanding:**
- [What is the user really trying to accomplish?]
- [What are current pain points in this workflow?]
- [How can we prevent common user errors?]

**Pattern Innovation:**
- [What novel interaction model could optimize this workflow?]
- [How can information architecture reduce cognitive load?]
- [What contextual assistance would help users succeed?]

**System Integration:**
- [How does this pattern fit within design system constraints from design-systems/[system-name]-core.md and [system-name]-components.md?]
- [Which design system components should be used for visual consistency?]
- [How will this pattern interact with other interface elements?]
- [What performance implications does this pattern have?]
- [How can design system accessibility standards be maintained?]

**User Experience Excellence:**
- [Does this pattern reduce time and effort for user goals?]
- [How does this approach compare to standard solutions?]
- [What makes this pattern learnable and efficient?]

**Generate patterns that are:**
- **Functionally Superior**: [Measurably better task completion than existing approaches]
- **Cognitively Optimized**: [Reduce mental effort while maintaining user control]  
- **Contextually Aware**: [Adapt appropriately to user state and environment]
- **Systematically Integrated**: [Work seamlessly within design system constraints]
