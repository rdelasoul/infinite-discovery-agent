# Perantara Reps Digital Platform UI Specification

## Core Challenge

Create a **trustworthy, culturally intelligent, and distinctively authentic** digital presence for Perantara Reps, the New Zealand Destination Management Company that Indonesian travel agents actually want to work with. The platform must embody the "Global-Local Connector" brand identity with the personality of a trustworthy older cousin - slightly unconventional, fashion-forward, but completely reliable when it matters.

Apply a distinctive design language that positions Perantara Reps as the DMC that truly "gets it" - understanding both Indonesian client needs and NZ local culture, solving travel agent challenges through an integrated platform that makes their job easier while making their clients' NZ experiences unforgettable.
