# Perantara Reps Digital Platform UI Specification

## Core Challenge

Create a **trustworthy, culturally intelligent, and distinctively authentic** digital presence for Perantara Reps, the New Zealand Destination Management Company that Indonesian travel agents actually want to work with. The platform must embody the "Your reliable NZ partner" brand identity with the personality of a trustworthy older cousin - slightly unconventional, fashion-forward, but completely reliable when it matters.

Apply a distinctive design language that positions Perantara Reps as the DMC that truly "gets it" - understanding both Indonesian client needs and NZ local culture, solving travel agent challenges through an integrated platform that makes their job easier while making their clients' NZ experiences unforgettable.
