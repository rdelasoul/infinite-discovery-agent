# Interactions Specification Configuration

# Shared dependencies to include when running /infinite interactions
dependencies:
  # Design system dependencies (optional for interactions)
  design-systems: []
    # - geist-core         # Include for consistent visual framework
    # - geist-components   # Include for component interaction patterns
  
  # Specification modules (recommended for interactions)
  spec-modules:
    - accessibility-standards      # Essential for inclusive interaction design
    - performance-requirements     # Critical for 60fps animation standards
    # - realistic-data-requirements # Include if interactions need business context
  
  # Data sets (optional, depends on interaction context)
  data: []
    # - ecommerce-data    # Include for shopping interaction patterns
    # - banking-data      # Include for financial interface interactions

# Experiment configuration
experiment:
  type: "interactions"
  output_format: "single-file"
  naming_pattern: "interaction_{iteration}.html"

# Notes:
# - Accessibility and performance are core requirements for interactions
# - Design system dependencies useful for consistent component interactions  
# - Data dependencies optional unless interactions need realistic business context
# - Focus on purposeful, performant, and accessible micro-interactions
# - Each iteration should demonstrate specific interaction patterns
