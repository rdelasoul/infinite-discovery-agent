# Experiments Directory

This directory contains all UI ideation and iteration experiments, organized by type for clean scalability and easy discovery.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Generate themed UI components
/infinite ui-components 5

# Generate website homepage iterations
/infinite website-homepages/perantara-reps 3

# Infinite generation mode
/infinite ui-components infinite
```

## Experiment Types

### 🎨 UI Components (`ui-components/`)
**Purpose**: Create themed hybrid UI components that combine multiple UI functions with distinctive design personalities.

**Command**: `/infinite ui-components [count]`

**Concept**: "Two birds with one stone" efficiency by combining functions like Search + Autocomplete + Filters + Recent Items into single components with themes like Organic Nature, Digital Minimalism, Cyberpunk, etc.

**Outputs**: 
- `single-file/` - All-in-one HTML files
- `multi-file/` - Separated HTML/CSS/JS

---

### 🌐 Website Homepages (`website-homepages/`)
**Purpose**: Generate complete homepage iterations for specific website projects.

**Commands**: 
- `/infinite website-homepages/perantara-reps [count]`
- `/infinite website-homepages/portfolio-site [count]`

**Focus**: Different design approaches while maintaining brand consistency and UX goals.

**Active Projects**:
- **Perantara Reps**: NZ DMC targeting Indonesian travel agents
- **Portfolio Site**: Personal portfolio showcasing capabilities

---

### ⚡ Interactions (`interactions/`)
**Purpose**: Explore micro-interactions, animations, and novel interaction patterns.

**Command**: `/infinite interactions [count]`

**Focus**: Performance-optimized animations, accessibility-conscious design, and innovative interaction paradigms.

*Note: This experiment type is ready for specifications and iterations.*

---

### 🧪 UI Innovations (`ui-innovations/`)
**Purpose**: Completely novel UI paradigms that replace existing interaction patterns.

**Command**: `/infinite ui-innovations [count]`

**Focus**: Revolutionary approaches to common UI elements with entirely new interaction models.

*Note: This experiment type is ready for specifications and iterations.*

## Adding New Experiment Types

1. **Create directory structure**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p experiments/[experiment-name]/iterations
   ```

2. **Create specification**:
   ```bash
   cp templates/[appropriate-template].md experiments/[experiment-name]/spec.md
   # Edit spec.md with specific requirements
   ```

3. **Add README.md**:
   Document the experiment's purpose, usage, and examples.

4. **Update this index**:
   Add the new experiment type to the list above.

## Best Practices

### Specification Quality
- **Ultra-detailed specs**: Follow the pattern of `ui-components/spec.md` (236 lines of detailed guidance)
- **Theme-first approach**: Strong thematic consistency across all elements
- **Quality standards**: Accessibility, performance, and user experience requirements
- **Evolution strategy**: How iterations should build upon each other

### Command Usage
- **Simple syntax**: `/infinite [experiment-path] [count]`
- **Auto-discovery**: Specs and output directories discovered automatically
- **Parallel generation**: Multiple agents create iterations simultaneously for efficiency

### Iteration Principles
- **Genuine uniqueness**: Each iteration must be meaningfully different
- **Progressive sophistication**: Later iterations push boundaries further
- **Thematic consistency**: Strong design personality throughout
- **Technical excellence**: Accessible, performant, responsive design

## Archive

Original experimental outputs are preserved in `../archive/` with date stamps for reference while maintaining the clean new structure.

## Templates

Specification templates for new experiment types are available in `../templates/`:
