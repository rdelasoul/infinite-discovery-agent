## Base Specification

# Bank Relationship Intelligence UX Pattern Specification

## Core Challenge

Create **innovative UX patterns** that optimize bank relationship manager workflows for analyzing small business portfolios through comprehensive **multi-source financial data integration**. Focus on demonstrating how **unified access to credit cards, external bank accounts, and accounting software** creates unprecedented portfolio intelligence, competitive insights, and relationship optimization that fragmented systems cannot achieve.

**Primary Business Context**: Banks analyzing 100+ small business clients (0-50 employees each) by integrating their credit cards, external bank accounts, and accounting software trial balances to generate actionable insights for relationship managers about upsell opportunities, competitive intelligence, and portfolio optimization.

**Core Platform Demonstration**: Show how **connected data platforms** transform traditional banking relationship management by providing unified financial visibility across all client data sources, enabling relationship intelligence impossible with fragmented systems.

## Multi-Source Data Integration Value Proposition

**The Transformation**: Traditional bank relationship managers work with fragmented data sources - separate views of their bank's accounts, external banking relationships, and isolated accounting records. This prototype demonstrates what becomes possible when these data sources are **unified in real-time** through a connected data platform.

**Platform Demonstration Purpose**: Showcase familiar bank relationship management workflows **transformed by multi-source integration** that provides:
- **Complete Financial Picture**: Real-time integration of credit cards, bank accounts, and accounting software data
- **Cross-Institution Intelligence**: Understanding client relationships with competitor banks and money flows
- **Portfolio Analytics**: Comprehensive analysis across 100+ integrated small business client profiles
- **Competitive Advantage**: Relationship intelligence that fragmented banking systems simply cannot provide

**What This Prototype Shows**: How connected data platforms transform routine relationship management into sophisticated portfolio intelligence systems that deliver superior client insights and revenue optimization.

**Target Customer Profile**: Bank relationship managers managing portfolios of 50-150 small business clients

**End User Roles**:
- **Relationship Manager**: Portfolio oversight, client interaction, opportunity identification, revenue optimization
- **Portfolio Manager**: Team oversight, performance analysis, strategic portfolio development
- **Risk Analyst**: Portfolio risk assessment, early warning systems, compliance monitoring
- **Business Development**: New client acquisition, competitive analysis, market expansion
