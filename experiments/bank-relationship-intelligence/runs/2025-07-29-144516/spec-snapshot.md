# Bank Relationship Intelligence UX Pattern Specification

## Core Challenge

Create **innovative UX patterns** that optimize bank relationship manager workflows for analyzing small business portfolios through comprehensive **multi-source financial data integration**. Focus on demonstrating how **unified access to credit cards, external bank accounts, and accounting software** creates unprecedented portfolio intelligence, competitive insights, and relationship optimization that fragmented systems cannot achieve.
