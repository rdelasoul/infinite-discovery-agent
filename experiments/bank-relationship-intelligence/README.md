# Bank Relationship Intelligence Experiment

## Overview

This experiment focuses on creating **Bank Relationship Intelligence UX patterns** that optimize relationship manager workflows for analyzing small business portfolios through comprehensive financial data integration. The patterns solve real bank relationship management challenges through smart information architecture and intelligence systems.

## Core Problem

Banks need to analyze 100+ small business clients (0-10 employees each) by integrating their:
- **Credit cards** (from all institutions)
- **Bank accounts** (from other banks) 
- **Accounting software** trial balances (QuickBooks, Xero)

This integrated data generates actionable insights for relationship managers about:
- **Upsell opportunities** (loans, credit lines, treasury services)
- **Risk monitoring** (early warning signals)
- **Portfolio optimization** (client prioritization)
- **Competitive intelligence** (understanding money flows to competitors)

## Target Users

### Primary Users (Bank Personnel)
- **Relationship Manager**: Portfolio of 25+ SMB clients, quota responsibility
- **Portfolio Manager**: Oversight of multiple relationship managers  
- **Risk Analyst**: Portfolio risk assessment and early warning systems
- **Business Development**: New client acquisition and competitive analysis

### Secondary Context (Small Business Clients)
- 100+ small businesses (0-10 employees)
- Multiple financial relationships and data sources
- Varying financial health and growth stages

## Key Innovation Areas

### Multi-Source Data Integration
