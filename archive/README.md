# Archive Directory

This directory contains the original experimental outputs and directory structures from before the repository was reorganized for better scalability and organization.

## Archived Content

### Legacy Experiments (`legacy-experiments-YYYYMMDD/`)
The original `legacy/` directory containing early UI innovation experiments:
- `src/` - ui_innovation_1.html through ui_innovation_10.html
- `src_enhanced/` - ui_enhanced_1.html through ui_enhanced_10.html  
- `themed_hybrid_all/` - ui_hybrid_1.html through ui_hybrid_15.html

### Original Source Directories
- `src-original-YYYYMMDD/` - Original `src/` with ui_hybrid_1.html through ui_hybrid_35.html
- `src-infinite-YYYYMMDD/` - Original `src_infinite/` with ui_hybrid iterations
- `src-group-YYYYMMDD/` - Original `src_group/` with multi-file component structure

- `portfolio-output-YYYYMMDD/` - Original portfolio website iterations

## Migration Notes

Content from these archived directories has been reorganized into the new `experiments/` structure:

- **UI Components**: Moved to `experiments/ui-components/single-file/` and `experiments/ui-components/multi-file/`
- **Website Projects**: Moved to `experiments/website-homepages/[project-name]/iterations/`
- **Specifications**: Organized into project-specific `spec.md` files

## Access

These archived files remain fully functional and can be referenced or moved back if needed. The archive preserves the original experimental approach while the new structure provides better organization for future iterations.
