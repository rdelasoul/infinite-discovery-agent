# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Infinite Discovery Agent** is an enhanced infinite agentic loop system for UI/UX experimentation through parallel AI iteration. The project orchestrates multiple AI agents to generate themed hybrid components, website variations, interactions, and UI innovations with progressive sophistication.

Built on the brilliant foundation of the original infinite agentic loop concept, this enhanced version provides clean organization, simplified commands, and scalable experiment types for unlimited creative discovery.

## Key Commands

### Running the Infinite Discovery Agent

```bash
claude
```

Then use the `/infinite` slash command with simplified syntax and auto-discovery:

```bash
# UI Components (themed hybrid components)
/infinite ui-components 1          # Single themed component
/infinite ui-components 5          # Small batch (5 parallel agents)
/infinite ui-components 20         # Large batch (batched parallel execution)
/infinite ui-components infinite   # Continuous generation with progressive sophistication

# Functional UX Patterns (workflow optimization through pattern innovation)
/infinite functional-ux-patterns 1 # Single UX pattern exploration
/infinite functional-ux-patterns 5 # Small batch (5 parallel pattern agents)
/infinite functional-ux-patterns 10 # Large batch of pattern variations

# Website Homepages (complete page iterations)
/infinite website-homepages/perantara-reps 3      # NZ DMC homepage variations
/infinite website-homepages/portfolio-site 5     # Portfolio homepage iterations

# Interactions (micro-interactions and animations)
/infinite interactions 10          # When interaction specs are added

# UI Innovations (novel interaction paradigms)  
/infinite ui-innovations 5         # When innovation specs are added
```

### Auto-Discovery System
- **Automatic spec detection**: Finds `experiments/{experiment-path}/spec.md`
- **Smart output routing**: Uses appropriate directories (`single-file/`, `iterations/`, etc.)
- **Zero configuration**: Just specify experiment type and count

## Architecture & Structure

### Enhanced Command System
The project uses Claude Code's custom commands feature with enhanced auto-discovery:
- `.claude/commands/infinite.md` - Enhanced infinite loop orchestrator with auto-discovery
- `.claude/commands/prime.md` - Context priming command for repository familiarization
- `.claude/settings.json` - Permissions configuration allowing Write, MultiEdit, Edit, and Bash

### Enhanced Specification & Dependency System
- **Experiment-specific specs**: Each experiment type has its own `experiments/{type}/spec.md`
- **Dependency configuration**: `experiments/{type}/spec-config.yml` controls shared component inclusion
- **Shared dependencies**: `experiments/shared/` provides reusable components across all experiment types
- **Template library**: `templates/` directory provides specification templates for new experiment types
- **Quality standards**: Ultra-detailed specifications with modular quality requirements
- **Evolution strategies**: How iterations should build upon each other with progressive sophistication

#### **Shared Dependencies Structure**
- **`experiments/shared/design-systems/`** - Reusable design frameworks (Geist system with 9+ files)
- **`experiments/shared/spec-modules/`** - Modular quality standards (accessibility, performance, realistic data)
- **`experiments/shared/data/`** - Realistic business context (banking, e-commerce, healthcare scenarios)

#### **Dependency Resolution Process**
1. Read experiment's `spec-config.yml` for dependency requirements
2. Resolve and include content from `shared/design-systems/`, `shared/spec-modules/`, and `shared/data/`
3. Create consolidated specification with all dependencies integrated
4. Provide complete context to AI agents for enhanced generation quality

### Experiment Types with Enhanced Run Management

### Multi-Agent Orchestration Pattern
The infinite command implements sophisticated parallel agent coordination:
1. **Specification Analysis** - Deeply understands the spec requirements
2. **Directory Reconnaissance** - Analyzes existing iterations to maintain uniqueness
3. **Parallel Sub-Agent Deployment** - Launches multiple agents with distinct creative directions
4. **Wave-Based Generation** - For infinite mode, manages successive agent waves
5. **Context Management** - Optimizes context usage across all agents

### Enhanced Content Organization with Run Management
- **`experiments/shared/`** - Reusable components across all experiment types
  - `design-systems/` - 9+ comprehensive Geist design system files
  - `spec-modules/` - Accessibility, performance, and data quality standards
  - `data/` - Realistic business context (banking, e-commerce scenarios)
- **`experiments/ui-components/runs/`** - Timestamped execution history
  - `2025-01-16-legacy-migration/` - 35+ themed hybrid components (legacy)
  - `[current-timestamp]/iterations/` - Latest generated components
  - `current/` - Symlink to most recent run
- **`experiments/functional-ux-patterns/runs/`** - UX pattern execution history with Geist constraints
- **`experiments/website-homepages/*/runs/`** - Project-specific homepage execution history
- **`experiments/interactions/runs/`** - Animation and micro-interaction execution history
- **`experiments/ui-innovations/runs/`** - Novel paradigm execution history
- **`archive/`** - All original experiments preserved with full attribution and date stamps
- **`templates/`** - Specification templates for creating new experiment types

#### **Run Directory Structure**
Each timestamped run contains:
```
runs/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS/
├── spec-snapshot.md          # Exact spec version used
├── config-snapshot.yml       # Dependency configuration used
├── dependencies/             # Resolved shared components
│   ├── design-systems/      # Design system files used

## Iterative Spec Development Workflow

### **Enhanced Workflow for Continuous Improvement**
The new architecture enables effortless iteration on specifications based on results without any manual folder management:

#### **1. Initial Exploration**
```bash
# Start with a basic configuration
/infinite ui-components 5
```
- Creates `runs/[timestamp]/` with initial spec and dependencies
- Generates 5 iterations with current specification approach
- Results accessible via `current/iterations/`

#### **2. Analysis & Refinement**
```bash
# Analyze results and identify improvements needed
# Edit spec.md to narrow scope or change approach
# Edit spec-config.yml to add/remove dependencies
```
- **Spec Evolution**: Modify `spec.md` based on what worked/didn't work
- **Dependency Adjustment**: Add design systems for consistency, remove for creative freedom
- **Data Context**: Include realistic data for business contexts, exclude for pure visual exploration

#### **3. Refined Execution**
```bash
# Run with refined specification
/infinite ui-components 3
```
- Creates new `runs/[timestamp]/` with updated spec and dependencies  
- Preserves complete history of previous approach
- Updates `current/` symlink to latest run

#### **4. Comparative Analysis**
```bash
# Compare approaches easily
ls experiments/ui-components/runs/
# 2025-01-16-143022/ (initial approach)
# 2025-01-17-091435/ (refined approach)
```
- **Side-by-side comparison**: Different spec versions and their results
- **Dependency impact**: See how shared components affected quality
- **Evolution tracking**: Clear progression from initial to refined approaches

#### **5. Continuous Iteration**
- **No folder proliferation**: Edit specs freely, automatic organization
