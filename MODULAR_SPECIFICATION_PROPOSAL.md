# Modular Specification Proposal

*Transform monolithic spec.md files into focused problem statements with reusable shared modules*

## Executive Summary

### The Problem We're Solving
**Specification Bloat**: Current spec.md files contain 500+ lines mixing creative problems with boilerplate requirements. Every new experiment copies hundreds of lines of accessibility standards, performance requirements, design tokens, and data specifications.

### The Solution: Modular Specifications
A **modular architecture** that separates creative problem definitions from implementation standards, enabling cleaner specs and faster experimentation through shared, reusable modules.

### Expected Benefits

#### Immediate Benefits
- âœ… **Cleaner specs**: 50-100 lines instead of 500+
- âœ… **Faster experimentation**: No more copying boilerplate
- âœ… **Consistent standards**: Update once, apply everywhere
- âœ… **Zero disruption**: Backward compatible with existing system

#### Long-term Benefits
- ðŸ“ˆ **Rapid prototyping**: New experiments in minutes, not hours
- ðŸŽ¯ **Clear focus**: Creative problems separated from implementation
- ðŸš€ **Easy maintenance**: Central updates to shared standards
- ðŸ’¡ **Flexible configuration**: Mix and match dependencies per experiment

## Core Concept: Separation of Concerns

### The Mental Model
```
FOCUSED PROBLEM + SHARED MODULES = COMPLETE SPECIFICATION
```

- **Focused Problem**: The unique creative challenge (in spec.md)
- **Shared Modules**: Reusable standards and requirements
- **Configuration**: Mix and match via spec-config.yml

### From Monolithic to Modular

**Before: Monolithic Specification**
```markdown
# UI Components Spec (Old Way)
- Problem statement (10 lines)
- Design system details (100+ lines)
- Accessibility standards (50+ lines)
- Performance requirements (30+ lines)
- Data examples (200+ lines)
- Ultra-thinking directives (100+ lines)
- Output format details (20+ lines)
- Moodboard aesthetic guidance (50+ lines)
```

**After: Problem-Focused Specification**
```markdown
# UI Components Spec (New Way)
## Problem Statement
What unique UI challenge are we solving?

## Core Approach
How do we solve it differently?

## Success Criteria
What makes a good solution?

## Output Requirements
Basic format and structure needs
```

### The New Architectural Split

```yaml
# spec-config.yml handles the "how" and "with what"
dependencies:
  design-systems: [geist-core]      # Pulls in 100+ lines of design tokens
  spec-modules: [accessibility]     # Pulls in 50+ lines of standards
  data: [banking-data]             # Pulls in 200+ lines of context
  moodboards: [modern-minimalist]  # Pulls in aesthetic guidance
  format: single-file              # Output format specification
```

## Benefits of Modular Approach

### 1. **Cleaner Problem Definition**
spec.md becomes about the **creative challenge** rather than implementation boilerplate:
- What problem are we solving?
- What makes this experiment unique?
- What are we trying to learn or prove?
- How do we measure success?

### 2. **Reusable Standards**
Common requirements move to shared modules:
- Accessibility â†’ `shared/spec-modules/accessibility-standards.md`
- Performance â†’ `shared/spec-modules/performance-requirements.md`
- Design tokens â†’ `shared/design-systems/geist-core.md`
- Brand guidelines â†’ `shared/moodboards/modern-minimalist.md`

### 3. **Flexible Configuration**
spec-config.yml enables mixing and matching:
```yaml
# Experiment A: Full constraints for production-ready work
dependencies:
  design-systems: [geist-core, geist-components]
  spec-modules: [accessibility, performance, security]
  moodboards: [modern-minimalist]
  data: [banking-data]

# Experiment B: Creative freedom for exploration
dependencies:
  design-systems: []               # No design constraints
  spec-modules: [accessibility]    # Only essential standards
  moodboards: [organic-nature]     # Different aesthetic direction
  data: []                        # Pure visual exploration
```

### 4. **Faster Experimentation Cycles**
When you have an idea for a new experiment:
1. Copy a similar experiment's folder
2. Update just the problem statement in spec.md
3. Adjust dependencies in spec-config.yml
4. Run it

No more copying hundreds of lines of boilerplate standards!

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Extract Common Sections (Day 1)
```bash
# Move repeated content to shared modules
mv "accessibility standards" â†’ experiments/shared/spec-modules/accessibility-standards.md
mv "performance requirements" â†’ experiments/shared/spec-modules/performance-requirements.md
mv "design system details" â†’ experiments/shared/design-systems/geist-core.md
```

### Phase 2: Update Configurations (Day 2)
```yaml
# Add to each experiment's spec-config.yml
dependencies:
  design-systems: [geist-core]
  spec-modules: [accessibility-standards, performance-requirements]
  moodboards: [modern-minimalist]
  data: [banking-data]
```

### Phase 3: Refactor Specifications (Day 3-5)
```markdown
# Update each spec.md to focus on unique aspects
- Remove boilerplate (now in shared modules)
- Focus on the creative problem
- Clarify success criteria
- Simplify approach guidelines
```

### Phase 4: Create Templates (Week 2)
```bash
# Create reusable templates for different experiment types
experiments/templates/
â”œâ”€â”€ standard-experiment-spec.md
â”œâ”€â”€ enhancement-experiment-spec.md
â”œâ”€â”€ website-experiment-spec.md
â””â”€â”€ component-experiment-spec.md
```

## Recommended Specification Structure

### Standard Experiment spec.md
```markdown
# [Experiment Name] Specification

## Problem Statement
<!-- 2-3 sentences on the core challenge -->
What specific UI/UX problem does this experiment address?

## Hypothesis
<!-- What we believe this approach will achieve -->
If we [approach], then we will [outcome] because [reasoning].

## Core Requirements
<!-- Only experiment-specific requirements -->
- Output format: [specific to this experiment]
- Naming convention: [pattern]
- Key constraints: [unique to this problem]
- File structure: [if different from standard]

## Success Metrics
<!-- How we measure if this worked -->
- Visual: What makes it visually successful?
- Functional: What makes it functionally successful?
- Innovation: What makes it novel or valuable?

## Approach Guidelines
<!-- High-level creative direction -->
- Theme philosophy: [how should this feel?]
- Innovation dimensions: [what should we explore?]
- User experience goals: [what should users experience?]

<!-- All implementation details handled by spec-config.yml -->
```

## Related Proposals

### Enhancement Framework
The Modular Specification Architecture works independently but complements the **Enhancement Framework Proposal** (see ENHANCEMENT_FRAMEWORK_PROPOSAL.md), which enables systematic enhancement of proven work through analytical strategies. When used together:
- Enhancement experiments benefit from cleaner, focused specs
- Shared modules ensure consistent quality across enhancements
- Both proposals maintain the same simple user interface

## The Bottom Line

**What We're Building**: A modular specification system that separates creative problems from implementation standards.

**Investment Required**: 1 week to extract and refactor existing specs.

**Expected ROI**: 3x faster experiment creation, cleaner documentation, easier maintenance.

**Success Indicator**: New experiments created in 30 minutes instead of 2 hours.
