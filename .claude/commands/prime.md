## System Architecture Context

This repository implements an enhanced infinite agentic loop pattern with:

- **Clean Organization**: Experiments categorized by type (ui-components, website-homepages, interactions, ui-innovations)
- **Simplified Commands**: Auto-discovery syntax like `/infinite ui-components 5`
- **Parallel AI Coordination**: Multiple agents generate iterations simultaneously
- **Theme-First Development**: Distinctive design personalities across all iterations
- **Quality Standards**: Accessibility, performance, and user experience requirements
- **Scalable Templates**: Easy addition of new experiment types

## Key Usage Patterns

The enhanced `/infinite` command supports:
- `/infinite ui-components [count]` - Themed hybrid UI components
- `/infinite website-homepages/[project] [count]` - Complete homepage iterations
- `/infinite interactions [count]` - Micro-interactions and animations
- `/infinite ui-innovations [count]` - Novel UI paradigms
