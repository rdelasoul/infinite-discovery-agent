## Enhanced System Architecture Context

This repository implements a sophisticated infinite agentic loop pattern with revolutionary improvements:

### **Shared Dependencies System**
- **`experiments/shared/design-systems/`** - Reusable design frameworks (Geist system with 9+ comprehensive files)
- **`experiments/shared/spec-modules/`** - Quality standards modules (accessibility, performance, data requirements)
- **`experiments/shared/data/`** - Realistic business context (banking, e-commerce, healthcare scenarios)

### **Dependency-Driven Specifications**
- **`spec-config.yml`** - Flexible dependency configuration per experiment
- **Automatic resolution** - `/infinite` command resolves and includes dependencies
- **Mix-and-match capability** - Any experiment can use any combination of shared components

### **Timestamped Run Management**
- **`runs/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS/`** - Each execution creates timestamped directory
- **Complete snapshots** - Spec, config, and resolved dependencies preserved
- **`current` symlinks** - Always point to most recent run for easy access
- **Historical comparison** - Easy analysis of spec evolution and results

### **Iterative Workflow Excellence**
- **Edit specs freely** - No manual folder creation required
- **Instant execution** - `/infinite` command handles all setup automatically
- **Compare approaches** - All previous runs preserved with their context
- **Rollback capability** - Easy return to previous spec versions and results

### **Advanced Parallel Coordination**
- **Dependency-aware agents** - Sub-agents receive complete resolved context
- **Enhanced uniqueness** - Global uniqueness across all historical runs
- **Quality consistency** - Shared modules ensure consistent standards
- **Scalable architecture** - Easy addition of new experiment types and dependencies

## Enhanced Usage Patterns

The dependency-enhanced `/infinite` command supports:

**Core Commands:**
- `/infinite ui-components [count]` - Themed hybrid UI components
- `/infinite functional-ux-patterns [count]` - Workflow optimization patterns  
- `/infinite website-homepages/[project] [count]` - Complete homepage iterations
- `/infinite interactions [count]` - Micro-interactions and animations
- `/infinite ui-innovations [count]` - Novel UI paradigms

**Advanced Workflow Examples:**
- Edit `spec.md` and `spec-config.yml` to refine scope and dependencies
- Run `/infinite ui-components 5` to create timestamped run with resolved dependencies
- Analyze results in `current/iterations/`
- Compare with previous runs to understand spec evolution impact
- Iterate infinitely without manual organization

## Current Run Analysis

ANALYZE the current state:
- Check `experiments/*/current` symlinks to see latest runs
- Review recent `runs/*/config-snapshot.yml` files to understand dependency usage patterns
- Examine `runs/*/dependencies/` to see resolved shared components
- Compare iteration results across different dependency configurations

## Archive Context

READ:
    archive/README.md

All original experimental work is preserved in `archive/` with full attribution. The current enhanced structure represents a revolutionary advancement enabling:
- Effortless spec iteration without folder proliferation
- Flexible dependency management across all experiment types  
- Complete historical preservation with reproducible contexts
- Scalable architecture for unlimited experiment expansion
