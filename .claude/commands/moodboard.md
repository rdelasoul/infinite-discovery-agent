# Moodboard Creation Assistant

Create and manage **visual inspiration moodboards** for aesthetic direction in infinite discovery experiments. This command helps bridge the gap between client aesthetic preferences ("I like this website") and actionable creative guidance for AI agents.

## Usage

```bash
# Interactive moodboard creation
/moodboard create [name]

# Analyze specific websites and create moodboard
/moodboard analyze [name] [url1] [url2] [url3]

# Add references to existing moodboard
